18,I do like the Fire Tablet - but I feel that if it is going to have a camera it should have been a better camera. The internet works but I find it takes a while to load. I have read a book on it but - I prefer to use my original paper white - that can be read in any lighting including outside. But for what it is and the price it was - its a good product.,Neutral,,,,

20,"I reviewed a lot of tablets before I bought this one. It is the first one I have ever purchased. I am no tech geek and it was pretty easy to figure out how to use it. I mostly bought it for and use it for: reading e-mail, facebook, and browsing the internet. I really like it and use it more than my laptop. But, if I need to do anything detailed, I use my laptop. Overall it's a great tablet for a beginner, and you can't beat the price.",Positive,,,,

33,"Great kids tablet, we have 4 of them now and they come in handy on long road trips. For the price they are a great buy.",Positive,,,,
34,So far my Fire is working well. I did have difficulty setting it up initially and had to ask a Best Buy tech to help me out. Connecting with my wireless was the most difficult step. The print is easy to read and can be enlarged. It is nice to be able to access e-mail. I find that it is easier to use if placed in a book-style protective case. That makes it easier to hold while reading. Anyone should enjoy using the Fire!,Neutral,,,,
35,"This tablet is perfect for my mom. She primarily uses it for playing games, the calendar and taking pictures. The camera is a decent camera for a 7"" tablet. Hopefully she'll use it to read books and magazines as well.",Positive,,,,

Purchased 4 one for each of my grandchildren so there is no more fighting of tablets. Great find! Thank you Best Buy. Also I purchased the insurance for these tablets because you know how little ones are. Overall everyone was very happy at Christmas,Positive,,,,
37,Got this tablet for my 7yr old daughter and it has been great for her. It's the right size for her little hands. Only drawback is the you can not get google apps on it. Apps have to be from Amazon and they might not have the app you want.,Neutral,,,,

40,"It's not a very powerful tablet. I needed something just to view Netflix and some other videos. Not to mention play some music and look at photos. Other than that I think it's too weak, not good for gaming. For the price though, you can't beat it.",Neutral,,,,

56,"Bought this tablet for my grandson, and we couldn't be happier. He loves it, and it is easy to use. Created the children's account, so he wouldn't be distracted by all the other goings on the internet. Bought this, so he could play games, do his school work, as it links up nicely to the IXL and Google class. Love the usage timer, and the ability to lock it down. I have loaded the Google Play Store on it, so we now access to many games and other apps. No issues so far. Great buy for the money. Only down side I can see (or in this case hear) so far, low sounding speaker. Could be a bit louder or better placed. All in all, you wont be disappointed in this purchase. Great for web page looks ups, reading and playing games.",Positive,,,,

I thought I would need the later Ipads to get decent performance but these units handled everything I needed to do. Videos play awesome, scrolling is super smooth.
